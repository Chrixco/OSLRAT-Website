## 🌊 Overview

OSLRAT is a comprehensive QGIS plugin and web platform designed to make sea-level rise assessment accessible to everyone. Built on IPCC AR6 projections and scientific best practices, OSLRAT provides powerful flood mapping, risk assessment, and scenario planning capabilities through an intuitive interface.

### Key Statistics (SSP5-8.5 Scenario)
- **280+ million people** at risk of displacement by 2100
- **$14 trillion** in global economic impact
- **1.10m average global sea-level rise** projected by 2100
